## Markdown (MD)
This file (readme.md) uses a different type of markup language called "Markdown", which shortens to MD. This is similar to HTML in that it uses some syntactical structures to create headings (#/##/###/etc.), lists (-), etc., instead of using elements/tags as in HTML.

Generally, markdown is used to add documentation to project readme files, which help developers share information about the project with collaborators.
